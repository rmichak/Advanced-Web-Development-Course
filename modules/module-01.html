        <section class="slide title-slide" data-narration="Welcome to Module 1 of Advanced Web Development. Before we can build modern web applications, we need to set up a professional development environment. Think of this as preparing your workshop before starting a project. The tools we'll install today—VS Code, Node.js, Git, and GitHub—are the same tools used by developers at companies like Google, Microsoft, and Netflix. By the end of this module, you'll have a complete, industry-standard setup ready for the rest of the course.">

        <!-- Learning Objectives -->
        <section class="slide" id="learning-objectives" data-narration="These are your concrete goals for today. Notice we're not just installing software—we're building understanding. You'll learn why each tool matters, not just how to click through an installer. The Git workflow at the end is especially important: clone, commit, push, and pull will become second nature to you by the end of this course, but it all starts here with understanding the fundamentals.">
            <h1>Learning Objectives</h1>
            <p>By the end of this module, you will be able to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Install and configure Visual Studio Code for web development</li>
                <li>Install Node.js and understand its role in modern web development</li>
                <li>Set up Git for version control on your local machine</li>
                <li>Create a GitHub account and connect it to your local Git</li>
                <li>Perform basic Git operations: clone, commit, push, and pull</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Why These Tools Matter -->
        <section class="slide" data-narration="Let me be direct: if you want to work as a web developer, these tools are non-negotiable. Every job posting you'll see expects proficiency with VS Code or similar editors, version control with Git, and collaboration through GitHub. But beyond job requirements, these tools will make you more productive. Version control means you'll never lose work again. GitHub gives you a portfolio that speaks louder than any resume. Start building that portfolio now—employers will look at your GitHub activity.">

Git is software that runs on your computer—it's the version control system that tracks changes. GitHub is a website that hosts Git repositories in the cloud. You could use Git without ever touching GitHub. You could also use alternatives like GitLab or Bitbucket. But GitHub has become the de facto standard for open source and many companies. Think of Git as your local tool and GitHub as the cloud service that lets you share and back up your work.">

        <!-- SSH Keys -->
        <section class="slide" id="ssh-setup" data-narration="SSH keys are the secure way to connect to GitHub. Instead of typing your password every time you push or pull, SSH uses cryptographic keys to authenticate you. It works like a lock and key: you generate a pair of keys—one private that stays on your computer, and one public that you give to GitHub. When you connect, GitHub challenges your computer to prove it has the private key that matches the public key you registered. This happens automatically and securely. The ed25519 algorithm we're using is modern and fast—it's the recommended choice for new keys.">
            <h1>Set Up SSH Keys</h1>

Copy everything from 'ssh-ed25519' through your email address. On GitHub, navigate to Settings, then SSH and GPG Keys. Paste your key there and give it a descriptive title like 'Work Laptop' or 'Home Desktop.' This helps you identify which key is which if you have multiple computers. Never share your private key—the file without the .pub extension. That must stay secret.">

        <!-- Git Workflow Overview -->
        <section class="slide" data-narration="Here's the mental model: Git works in stages. First, you make changes to files—just normal editing. Then you stage the changes you want to save—think of this as putting items in a box. Next, you commit those staged changes—sealing the box with a label describing what's inside. Finally, you push to GitHub—shipping the box to the cloud. This staged approach gives you precise control over what gets saved and when. You might change ten files but only want to commit three of them in one logical group.">

        <!-- Clone a Repository -->
        <section class="slide" data-narration="Cloning is how you get a repository from GitHub onto your computer. When you clone, you get everything—all the files, all the history, all the branches. The SSH URL we're using starts with 'git@github.com' rather than 'https://'. Since you set up SSH keys, this URL will authenticate automatically. Cloning creates a new folder with the repository name, so make sure you're in the right parent directory before running the command.">
            <h1>Clone a Repository</h1>
            <p>Download a repository from GitHub to your computer:</p>
            <pre><code>git clone git@github.com:username/repository-name.git</code></pre>
            <p>This creates a folder with all the project files and Git history.</p>
            <div class="info-box">

        <!-- Check Status -->
        <section class="slide" data-narration="Git status is your best friend—run it constantly. It tells you exactly what Git sees: which files are new, which are modified, and which are ready to commit. The output is color-coded: red means untracked or modified but not staged; green means staged and ready to commit. Make it a habit to run 'git status' before and after every Git operation. It helps you understand what's happening and catch mistakes before they become problems.">
            <h1>Check Repository Status</h1>
            <p>See what files have changed:</p>
            <pre><code>git status</code></pre>
            <p>This shows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Untracked files:</strong> New files Git doesn't know about</li>
                <li><strong>Modified files:</strong> Changed files not yet staged</li>
                <li><strong>Staged files:</strong> Files ready to be committed</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Stage Changes -->
        <section class="slide" data-narration="The staging area is a Git concept that trips up beginners. Why not just commit directly? Because staging lets you craft meaningful commits. Say you fixed a bug and also reformatted some code. Those are two different logical changes. You can stage and commit the bug fix first, then stage and commit the formatting separately. This keeps your project history clean and makes it easier to review changes or roll back if needed. The 'git add .' shortcut stages everything, which is convenient but use it thoughtfully.">
            <h1>Stage Your Changes</h1>
            <p>Add files to the staging area:</p>
            <pre><code># Add a specific file
git add filename.html

# Add all changed files
git add .

# Add all files of a type
git add *.css</code></pre>
            <div class="highlight-box">

            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- Commit Changes -->
        <section class="slide" data-narration="A commit is a snapshot of your project at a point in time. The message describes what changed and why. Good commit messages are invaluable—when you're debugging six months from now, you'll thank yourself for writing clear messages. Start with an imperative verb: 'Add feature,' 'Fix bug,' 'Update styles.' Not 'Added' or 'Adding'—think of completing the sentence 'This commit will...' Keep the first line under 50 characters. If you need more detail, add a blank line and then a longer description.">

        <!-- Push to GitHub -->
        <section class="slide" data-narration="Commits only exist locally until you push them. Think of push as syncing your local history with GitHub. The word 'origin' is an alias for your GitHub repository URL—Git sets this up automatically when you clone. 'main' is the branch name; historically this was called 'master,' but 'main' is now the standard. After pushing, your commits are backed up in the cloud, visible on GitHub, and available for collaborators to pull.">

        <!-- Pull from GitHub -->
        <section class="slide" data-narration="Pull is the opposite of push—it downloads commits from GitHub to your computer. This is essential when working with others. If a teammate pushes changes while you're working, you need to pull their changes before you can push yours. Make pulling the first thing you do when starting work. It only takes a second and prevents painful merge conflicts. Conflicts happen when you and someone else change the same lines of code—easier to prevent than to resolve.">

        <!-- Tips for Success -->
        <section class="slide" data-narration="Let me share some wisdom from years of professional development. Commit often—small, focused commits are easier to understand and easier to undo if something goes wrong. Always pull before starting work to avoid conflicts with teammates. Push daily so your work is backed up. And please, read error messages. Git's error messages are actually helpful—they usually tell you exactly what went wrong and often suggest how to fix it. On the don't side: never commit passwords, API keys, or any credentials. Once they're in Git history, they're there forever, even if you delete the file. Keep commits focused—a commit that says 'Fixed stuff' with 50 changed files is useless for debugging. And don't panic about merge conflicts—they're normal and fixable.">
